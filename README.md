**Abstract:**   
Human growth hormone (hGH) is a therapeutically important endocrine factor
that signals various cell types. Structurally and functionally, the
interactions of hGH with its receptor have been resolved in fine detail, such
that hGH and hGH receptor variants can be practically engineered by either
random or rational approaches to achieve significant changes in the free
energies of binding. A somewhat unique feature of hGH action is its
homodimerization of two hGH receptors, which is required for intracellular
signaling and stimulation of cell proliferation, yet the potencies of hGH
mutants in cell-based assays rarely correlate with their overall receptor-
binding avidities. Here, a mathematical model of hGH-stimulated cell signaling
is posed, accounting not only for binding interactions at the cell surface but
induction of receptor endocytosis and downregulation as well. Receptor
internalization affects ligand potency by imposing a limit on the lifetime of
an active receptor complex, irrespective of ligand-receptor binding
properties. The model thus explains, in quantitative terms, the numerous
published observations regarding hGH receptor agonism and antagonism and
challenges the interpretations of previous studies that have not considered
receptor trafficking as a central regulatory mechanism in hGH signaling.
